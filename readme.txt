272 Merry Orks is a sample library of female death metal vocals.

Tested using Plogue Sforzando but should work in other SFZ-compatible samplers. Three SFZ mappings are included. One for assembling death metal vocals, one with all the pre-drop samples, and one for monster voice sound design - most of the same samples as the death metal vocals, but triggering one mutes any sample currently playing.
